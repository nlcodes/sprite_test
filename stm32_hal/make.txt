make_utils

About:
  Make/build utilities for stm32_hal library and supported peripherals
  Desinged to provide a toolchain for building c projects on linux
  Includes a startup, linker, and Makefile
  Uses scheme lisp for a build script to automate the build process

Dependancies:
  Dependancies for the make.scm script include gambit scheme,
  gnu make, gcc arm toolchain, and st-link utilities

Instructions:
  As specified in hal master directory readme, move all files into
  working project master directory
  Program should be called "main.c"
  After installing dependancies run "gsi make.scm" while using
  supported peripherals, and it will build the program (test.bin)
  The script will also automatically flash the .bin to the mcu via swd
  If you would like to build without flashing,
  duplicate the script and remove the command at line 9
  Ensure the script has proper permissions to run

NOTE:
  You may need to edit the make utilities to match your exact setup 
  The utilities provide an outline for an easy build and what has 
  worked with the tested mcu and peripherals
